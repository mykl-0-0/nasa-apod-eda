# NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) — Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores data from NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook demonstrates how to pull images and metadata from the API, process the results, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Project Goals
- Access NASA's APOD API and retrieve image data over a specified time period.  
- Explore the dataset to identify trends in topics, media types, and image descriptions.  
- Practice using Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.  
- Build a foundation for a portfolio project in data science with space-related data.
